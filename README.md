# Description
Do not use this plugin on a live server, there are some missing files (like configs or materials).

This is made public to see or use the trap logic (player activates trap => it assigns a kill if it contributes to the player death).
It has terrorist command, life transfer, timer, terrorist killer, endings etc.

This is purely my vision on the deathrun gamemode.
